# SuperSimpleBank
This is a repo for a super simple online bank application in Java to run in Windows.  I am working on running it in Linux and MacOS distributions. 

WARINING / DISCLAIMER: No security or error handling implementations have been added.

To run this app from the command line (after compilation) in Microsoft Windows:
{See RunMe.bat comments for compilation notes}

Prerequisites:

The JRE must be installed.
You can get it at https://www.java.com/en/ 
 

Instructions to run the program:

1.	Double click the RunMe.bat file. 
2.	Respond to the prompts.
* The menu items are shown.
* The user selects an item in response to the selection prompts.
* Please follow the on screen prompts carefully.
3.	Press 5 and hit the enter key to exit at the end.
 
Example Output:

 

Troubleshooting:

If there is an error message stating that “’java’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file” then you do not have the JRE installed.  Please see the prerequisites to install it.
